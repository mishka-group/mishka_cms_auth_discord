- Needs mishka_cms_core 0.0.4 and mishka_gervaz 0.0.3, where it needed 0.0.2 of each. The core's 0.0.3 release moved the visual editor into the new mishka_cms_builder package. The Discord sign-in itself does not change
- The release runs on Erlang 29.1.2 and Elixir 1.20.5. The temporary OTP 29.0.5 pin is removed, because the download libraries fetch precompiled NIFs again on newer OTP versions
